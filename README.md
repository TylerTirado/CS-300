For this course, we were tasked with the project of creating a data structure that will be the most efficient in reading a text file and reading each line of the file and storing the read data into the data structure. The data structure would store the class id, class name, and any pre-req courses needed to take the class in each element. You would be able to access a menu that would import the data file, fill in the data structure chosen and be able to access specific elements and also sort each element in alphanumeric order. I approached this problem by comparing multiple data structures (vectors, linked lists, binary search trees) and seeing the breakdown of their runtime analysis to determine which would perform the most efficiently given the worst case for each data structure. Some of the roadblocks I had was the actual decision of which data structure would be the best fit. Honestly what it came down to was the fact that the data file I was importing wasn't a very large set of data so I figured the difference between the data structures would be minimal, and decided that using a vector would be the best fit. This is because I found it to be one of the easiest to implement and by using the quicksort method for sorting it was a very fast process. This project has highlighted the fact that taking the time the plan out your program and determining what you plan to do with the data as well as the quantity of data can determing the most efficient data structure needed depending on your goals. This is helpful since I didn't really think about runtime analysis based on worst case which is helpful to know if you want to avoid longer runtimes and wasted memory usage.

Thanks for reading!
